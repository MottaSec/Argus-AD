SimpleMisconfigurations,LAPS Not Deployed on Servers,Critical,"LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) is not deployed on any of the 42 member servers in the domain.","Without LAPS, local administrator passwords may be the same across servers, allowing lateral movement if one server is compromised. This is particularly dangerous in server environments.","AEGIS-AD can deploy and configure LAPS across all member servers to ensure unique, regularly rotated local administrator passwords."
PrivilegeEscalation,DCSync Rights for Non-Administrative Accounts,Critical,"2 non-administrative accounts have been granted DCSync rights, allowing them to perform domain controller replication operations.","Accounts with DCSync rights can extract password hashes for all domain accounts, including Domain Admins, effectively compromising the entire domain.","AEGIS-AD will remove DCSync rights from unauthorized accounts and implement proper monitoring for any future attempts to assign these permissions."
SimpleMisconfigurations,KRBTGT with ServicePrincipalNames,Critical,"The KRBTGT account has ServicePrincipalNames (SPNs) assigned, making it potentially vulnerable to Kerberoasting.","If the KRBTGT account is Kerberoastable, attackers could potentially extract and crack its password hash, leading to complete domain compromise via Golden Ticket attacks.","AEGIS-AD will remove any unnecessary SPNs from the KRBTGT account and ensure it is properly secured."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Domain Admin Sessions on Non-Tier 0 Systems,High,"Domain Administrators are logging into non-Tier 0 systems, violating the principle of privileged access workstation usage.","When Domain Admins log into lower-tier systems, their credentials are cached and can be extracted if those systems are compromised, potentially leading to domain compromise.","AEGIS-AD can implement and enforce a tiered administration model with proper Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) for administrative activities."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Dangerous RDP Rights,High,"Found 3 Group Policy Objects that grant Remote Desktop access to overly broad groups like 'Everyone', 'Authenticated Users', or 'Domain Users'.","Granting RDP access to broad groups significantly increases the attack surface for lateral movement and can allow attackers to move throughout the network once they've compromised a single account.","AEGIS-AD can reconfigure Remote Desktop permissions to follow the principle of least privilege, restricting access to only necessary administrative or support accounts."
SimpleMisconfigurations,RDP Not Hardened,High,"No Group Policy Objects were found that harden Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) security settings.","Without proper RDP hardening, connections may use weaker encryption and authentication methods, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and credential theft.","AEGIS-AD can configure Group Policy to enforce RDP hardening, including requiring Network Level Authentication, TLS 1.2 security, and high encryption levels."
LateralMovement,Excessive Administrative Local Group Memberships,High,"Found excessive administrative local group memberships across multiple systems, with several domain groups granted local administrator access to multiple machine types.","Excessive local administrator rights enable lateral movement and privilege escalation, as attackers can compromise one account and move freely among systems where that account has administrative access.","AEGIS-AD can implement a least-privilege approach to local administrative access, removing unnecessary rights and implementing Just-In-Time administration where appropriate."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Weak Password Policy,High,"The domain password policy requires only 7 characters with no complexity requirements.","Weak password policies allow users to create easily guessable passwords, increasing vulnerability to password spraying, brute force, and other password attacks.","AEGIS-AD can implement a strong domain password policy aligned with modern standards, requiring longer passwords (14+ characters) with appropriate complexity."
PrivilegeEscalation,Shadow Admin Accounts,Medium,"Found 3 accounts with indirect paths to administrative privileges through nested group memberships or permissions.","Shadow admin accounts often bypass security controls and monitoring focused on well-known administrative groups, allowing attackers to maintain persistence with less chance of detection.","AEGIS-AD can identify and remediate all shadow admin paths while implementing proper privileged access management practices."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Weak Password History Policy,Medium,"The domain password history policy is set to remember only 5 previous passwords.","A weak password history policy allows users to cycle through a small set of passwords, reducing the effectiveness of password changes.","AEGIS-AD can strengthen the password history policy to remember at least 24 previous passwords, preventing password reuse."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Password Never Expires Accounts,Medium,"Found 27 enabled user accounts with 'Password Never Expires' flag set.","Accounts with passwords that never expire may retain the same password for years, increasing the risk that these credentials will be compromised through various attack methods.","AEGIS-AD can implement appropriate password expiration policies while providing alternative solutions for service accounts and other special cases."
SimpleMisconfigurations,Dormant User Accounts,Medium,"Found 42 user accounts that have not logged in for over 90 days.","Dormant accounts provide an attack surface with little chance of detection, as activity on these accounts is unlikely to be noticed.","AEGIS-AD can implement automated processes to identify, disable, and eventually remove dormant accounts according to your organization's policies."
HybridAD,Azure AD Connect Privileged Account Sync,Informational,"On-premises privileged accounts are being synchronized to Azure AD, creating potential security risks.","Synchronizing privileged on-premises accounts to Azure AD could expand the attack surface for these accounts, especially if they're used for cloud authentication.","AEGIS-AD can implement filtering to prevent critical on-premises accounts from being synchronized to Azure AD while maintaining necessary hybrid functionality."
